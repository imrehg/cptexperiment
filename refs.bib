  abstract = {Coherent spectroscopy of degenerate two-level systems of the Doppler-broadened
	D2 cesium line has been performed in vacuum and in buffer gas cells.
	Subnatural-width (SNW) electromagnetically induced transparency and
	electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) resonances have been
	observed with single-frequency laser excitation for different light
	polarizations and collision regimes. SNW-EIA resonances with linearly
	polarized excitation of the Fg=4 level are observed, and they increase
	their contrast with power density increase and reach a contrast of
	20% at 200 mWcm-2. A theoretical model has been elaborated, taking
	into account the Doppler broadening of the transitions, the linewidth
	of the laser light, and the experimental conditions for observation
	of the fluorescence. Here the theoretical results are in agreement
	with those of the experiment. In a buffer gas cell, the SNW resonances
	in the fluorescence, in degenerate two-level systems are observed
	for the first time and they are only obtained with circularly polarized
	light. A theoretical explanation of this result is proposed. At the
	expense of contrast, in the presence of a buffer gas the coherent
	resonances are significantly narrower than in a vacuum cell for the
	same power density. The observation of SNW resonances in buffer gas
	is significantly less sensitive to the laser frequency drift than
	in a vacuum cell, which could be advantageous for applications in
	metrology and in the measurement of weak magnetic fields.},

	derive an effective nonlinear interaction Hamiltonian in the adiabatic
	limit. In contrast to conventional nonlinear optics, this Hamiltonian
	does not have a power expansion in the fields and the conversion
	length decreases with decreasing input power. We analyze the stationary
	wave-mixing process in the forward scattering configuration using
	an exact numerical analysis for up to 103 input photons and compare
	the results with a mean-field approach. Due to quantum effects, complete
	conversion from the two pump fields into the signal and idler modes
	is achieved only asymptotically for large coherent pump intensities
	or for pump fields in few-photon Fock states. The signal and idler
	fields are perfectly quantum correlated which has potential applications
